# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-MRI-Dataset.

In this thesis, the main problem addressed was the challenge of accurate brain tumor detection and classification from MRI images, a task that is traditionally prone to human error and is time-consuming. We focused on overcoming several key issues in medical image analysis, such as data scarcity, class imbalance, and model generalization. By leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, we addressed the problem of limited annotated datasets, enhancing the diversity and size of the training data. Furthermore, we employed a hybrid CNN-ViT model to capture both local features and global context in MRI images, which provided significant improvements in classification performance. The incorporation of transfer learning allowed for fine-tuning pre-trained models on small, domain-specific datasets, improving model accuracy and reducing the reliance on large annotated datasets.

The results of the study were promising, with the hybrid CNN-ViT model achieving a test accuracy of 97.2%. This demonstrates the model's ability to effectively distinguish between healthy and tumor MRI images. The confusion matrix and classification report further highlighted the model's robustness, with minimal false positives and false negatives, as well as excellent precision, recall, and F1-score values for both classes. These results indicate that the proposed models can reliably assist in brain tumor detection. Future research directions include exploring multi-modal data integration (e.g., combining MRI, CT, and PET scans), optimizing real-time performance for clinical deployment, and improving the interpretability of AI models to gain clinician trust and enable their seamless integration into healthcareÂ workflows.
